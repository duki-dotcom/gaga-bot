# Gaga Bot Privacy Policy
-# This Privacy Policy describes how Gaga Bot ("the Bot"), a Discord bot, handles information collected from its users and the Discord servers it operates in.

## By inviting the Bot to your server or interacting with it, you agree to the terms of this policy.

1. What Data We Collect
Gaga Bot is designed to be a simple, fun experience and collects a minimal amount of data necessary for its operation. The Bot may temporarily collect the following non-personal information:

Guild IDs: The unique identifier for the Discord server (guild) the Bot is in. This is necessary to remember server-specific settings and to operate within a specific server's context.

Channel IDs: The unique identifier for the channel where a command is issued. This allows the Bot to respond in the correct location.

User IDs: The unique identifier for a user who interacts with the Bot. This is used solely to respond to commands and is not linked to any personal information.

The Bot does not collect, store, or process any of the following:

Your Discord username, email address, or any other personally identifiable information.

Your personal messages or server chat logs.

Any information about you that is not directly related to your interaction with the Bot's commands.

2. How We Use Your Data
The data collected is used exclusively for the functionality of the Bot itself. Specifically, this data is used to:

Respond to your commands and queries.

Deliver lyrics and other content to the correct server and channel.

Maintain a consistent user experience.

We will never use your data for advertising, tracking, or sell it to third parties.

3. Data Storage and Security
The data collected is not stored in a long-term database. It is processed in-memory and discarded as soon as the command is completed. The Bot's code is hosted on secure servers, and we take reasonable measures to protect any temporary data from unauthorized access.

4. Third-Party Services
Gaga Bot relies on the Discord API to function. Your interaction with the Bot is also subject to Discord's own Privacy Policy. The Bot does not share any of its collected data with any other third-party services.

5. Your Rights
Because we do not store your data, there is no personal data for us to provide or delete. If you wish to revoke all access to your information, you can simply kick the Bot from your Discord server. This will instantly remove all information the Bot has about your server and its members.

6. Policy Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on the Bot's public repository or related Discord server. Your continued use of the Bot after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.

7. Contact Us
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to open an issue on the public GitHub repository for the Bot's information.
